						 My journey into tech started with a degree in Computer Science. I was hooked and wanted to learn how to build my own site to fit my own specific needs. Firstly designe my demo sites are online Air-tickect reservation and online jwellery site which is my best pickup point in my life to turn me as web-developer.
					</p>

					<p>
						I like to decoration even dosen't mater it's for website or for my home. That curiosity then opened a door that could never be shut. When I learned how to build my first website, I realized I found something that gave me the freedom & versatility I was looking for in my work. Now I've made a full switch to front-end development, where I can use my organization skills.
